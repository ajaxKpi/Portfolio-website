        I've been doing a photo from an early age is my inspiration. My style - Western picture.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        What I take to heart - all have long known. And I thought about it, and the universe is aware and somehow spared me, but no.))
        So it was that I decided to devote himself to photography. I like it a long time ago and liked since high school, but with the advent of the first reflex - so in general there was an explosion. IN 2007.
        This year I decided! (since everything asserted - "It's time!").
        The truth is I was not warned that there will be hard times and immediately.
        <br>
        All people have the intuition, and if it is something you just said without thinking (the mind including rapid brain, cheers), it is best to listen! So it was with my last commercial shooting (let's call them so), but the first thought was "to give." But my good soul in general is always going to meet all (why?)

        The first client has expressed outrage after I gave the material to the words "blur the background - this is a joke? Photoshop? No, well, I, too, can do for fun,
        but why should it? could not prevent? "
        Conclusion: not only a show, but tell everyone that my background pictures - blurred. Thank optics.)
        <br>
        The second client was unhappy with the fact that not all come into focus. Here my error, and movements of people.
        Conclusion: never give all the good stuff, give only the cream-cream.
        <br>
        Many passers people do not even know how much is now away from the photo template and classics. No you compositions, the golden ratio, "unclip head" and even focus. All of this - not the point!
        The main thing - feelings, emotions. What you do not remember ever in my head of what your heart is overflowing with exciting experiences and warmth. And only you can think about it. And then remember that feeling only through photographs. And absolutely no matter how their professionalism rolls.

        I promise myself never to agree to work with people that are traded for every penny, and believe that a photographer - a robot with a camera, and there is nothing to appreciate, and even more so - and even pay.
        <br>
        BUT! All that is done - all the better!
        <br>
        At such moments I find myself govnofotografom and wonder what really hands grow from there. But then I remember that I have a support team that knows how I love. And you want to do it for them. Thank you!)
